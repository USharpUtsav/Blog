                The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America. The
                league is composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada) and is one of the major
                professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. It is the premier men's professional
                basketball league in the world.[3]<br>

                The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America
                (BAA).[1] It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging
                with the competing National Basketball League (NBL).[4] In 1976, the NBA and the American Basketball
                Association (ABA) merged, adding four franchises to the NBA. The NBA's regular season runs from October
                to April, with each team playing 82 games. The league's playoff tournament extends into June. As of
                2020, NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.
